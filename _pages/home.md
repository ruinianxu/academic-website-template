### Welcome!

I am an ECE Ph.D. candidate advised by [Patricio A. Vela](https://pvela.gatech.edu/) at Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Tech. 
I am a member of [Visman](https://sites.google.com/view/ivalab-visman/home) in [IVALab](https://ivalab.gatech.edu/). 
My research interest is mainly about utilizing multi-modal information including visual and linguistic data to tackle real-world challenges in robotics.
To be more specific, I am working on Human Instruction Following, Affordance Understanding, and Object Grasping. [[View my CV](papers/Resume_ruinianxu.pdf)] (Updated in March 2023).
